        I recently decided to go in another direction... just one final word for

        So impressed with all you do
        <br />
        Tried so hard to be like you
        <br />
        Flew too high and burnt the wing
        <br />
        Lost my faith in everything
        <br />
        Lick around divine debris
        <br />
        Taste the wealth of hate in me
        <br />
        Shedding skin, succumb defeat
        <br />
        This machine is obsolete
        <br />
        Made the choice to go away
        <br />
        Drink the fountain of decay
        <br />
        Tear a hole exquisite red
        <br />
        Fuck the rest and stab it dead
        <br />
        Broken, bruised, forgotten sore
        <br />
        Too fucked up to care anymore
        <br />
        Poisoned to my rotten core
        <br />
        Too fucked up to care anymore
        <br />
        Broken, bruised, forgotten sore
        <br />
        Too fucked up to care anymore
        <br />
        Poisoned to my rotten core
        <br />
        Too fucked up to care anymore
        <br />
        In the back off the side far away
        <br />
        Is a place where I hide, where I stay
        <br />
        Tried to say, tried to ask I needed to
        <br />
        All alone by myself, where were you?
        <br />
        How could I ever think it's funny how?
        <br />
        Everything you swore it wouldn't change, is different now
        <br />
        Just like you would always say, "We'll make it through"
        <em>Then my head fell apart and where were you?</em>
        <br />
        How could I ever think it's funny how? Everything you swore would never
        change, is different now
        <br />
        <em>
          Like you said, "You and me make it through" We didn't quite, it fell
          apart, where the fuck were you?
        </em>
